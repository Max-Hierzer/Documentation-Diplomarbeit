## 2. Discussed Topics
### 2.1 Testing Google-Meet
- **Summary:**  
  We tested it with a short meeting. Talking and Screensharing worked, Prasser has some Backround noise in his microphone.

### 2.2 Summary of a simple project
- **Summary:**  
  We learned how the whole techstack works and how the parts are connected to each other.
- **Discussion:**  
  1. How does everything work so far?
  2. How can we use SQL statements like update and delete in Sequelize?
  3. How does the connection between front- and backend work?
  4. How can we show/hide parts of our website?
- **Results:**  
  1. We went through the stack step by step to understand how everything is connected.
  2. Statements like insert are done with the create method from sequelize, update and delete need more research.
  3. We learned that the backend listenes for api requests. If it gets one it acts according to the kind of request.
  4. We can use state-variables to save current state e.g. isLoggedIn.
  
### 2.3 Discussing new features
- **Summary:**  
  We know how we want to design the frontend and need to do some research for sequelize.
- **Discussion:**  
  1. How can we create relations in Sequelize to create our poll-system?
  2. How should we arrange the frontend?
  3. How can we manage different roles for our users?
- **Results:**  
  1. Needs more research.
  2. Rearrange the frontend, to have login and register separately.
  3. Need to change current model in sequelize.
